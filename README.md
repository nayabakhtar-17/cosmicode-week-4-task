# cosmicode-week-4-task
Here is the week 4 task for remote internship at cosmicode in the domain of machine learning 

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains the implementation of machine learning tasks developed and executed in .Google Colab
The project focuses on data analysis, machine learning model training and visualization allowing easy execution in a cloud-based environment without local setup.

📌 Project Tasks

*Task 1*: Feedforward Neural Network from Scratch (NumPy)
Implements a 3-layer neural network entirely using NumPy.
Includes forward pass, backpropagation, loss computation, and training loop.
Trained on a small synthetic dataset for binary classification.


*Task 2*: Deep Neural Network on MNIST (Keras)
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model using TensorFlow/Keras.
Trained on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset.
Achieves high accuracy with ReLU activations and Adam optimizer.


*Task 3:* Regularization Techniques (Dropout + L2)
Demonstrates how to use dropout layers and L2 weight regularization in Keras.
Shows performance differences compared to non-regularized models.

*Task 4:* Convolutional Neural Network on CIFAR-10
Custom CNN architecture built with Keras for image classification.
Includes data augmentation, batch normalization, and learning-rate scheduling.
Designed to achieve at least 70%+ accuracy on CIFAR-10.
